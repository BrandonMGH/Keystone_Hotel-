To start both the front end server and the back end server simultaneously, first clone the repository down to a directory of your choice, install all the node packages in both the root and client directories of the cloned repository, then run the command "npm run devStart" in root directory.

### STRETCH GOALS

- Need to improve the design of the app overall so that it is more mobile friendly.
- Need to apply additional styling to the map route inside of the map route modal.
- Need to make it so that after a marker is clicked, the generated route to that marker from the users current location is not displayed until they click on the generate route button inside of the modal. 
- Need to add more central county markers
