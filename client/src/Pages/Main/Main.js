                    <p>We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you.
    
    Die Wanna Wanga! Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt...and a gift. Gift, what gift? Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie. He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Nudd Chaa. Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. Good morning. Bo Shuda! The message, Artoo, the message.
    
    If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance. Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have. You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it... I have it ...and...my sister has it. Yes. It's you Leia. I know. Somehow...I've always known. Then you know why I have to face him.
    
Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield. The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed. We're starting our approach. Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived. Yes, sir.</p>
